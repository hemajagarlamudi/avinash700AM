EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud : 

	Elastic	CPU		Cloud
		Storage
		Memory
		Applications/software
		Network
		GPU


Traditional Scenario : Server to test your application : 

Application : 	100 customers --> 1M customers (We will look for 1M cus Configuration)

--> 100% upfront		ROI 

EC2: 100 Cus : t2.medium --> t3.4xlarge -----> Servers+ELB --> 100s servers --> 10 sers


Scaling :
Vertical Scaling : 
Horizontal scaling : 

Instance = Server


On-Demand ec2 instance : no specific workloads / usecases, If you want to test your application in AWS.. First time usage on aws.. 

Pricing : /hr and /sec (With min of 10 sec)


Reserved Instances (RI) : Predictable workloads, stable workloads, long term runs on aws..  Duration : 1 Year / 3 Years.. 

Standard RI : We cannot upgrade the selected configuration within the duration. 
Convertable RI : We can change/upgrade the configuration. 
Scheduled RI : repeated/scheduled intervals, we can run our ec2 instance.

Pricing : Full Upfront : Pay everything while purchasing instance. 
	  Partial Upfront : pay 30-50% while purchasing, remaining amount pay monthly 			    basis (but with reduced hourly price)
	  No Upfront : No need to pay anything, but most of the times cost same as on-			demand instances.

AWS Marketplace : We can register as a seller and sell our products/applications/instances.


Spot Instance: When we have flexible start/stop options for our instances.. If you need high configuration servers ar lowest cost for specific durations.. 

--> We need to bid our ouwn price against aws pricing. If bid price is same/greater than as aws pricing we will get an ec2 instance. 
 
--> Pricing history

--> We can create a fleet requets.

3 hr 35 Min 20 Sec --> Price increased and AWS Terminated your isnatccne : 3 Hrs.. 
3 hr 35 Min 20 Sec --> Price not increased and you Terminated inatccne : full duration 
								3 hr 35 Min 20 Sec


Step 1 : Choose an AMI (Amazon Machene Image) : Choose your required OS. 

An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch your instance.


Step 2 : Step 2: Choose an Instance Type
t2.micro (1vCPU, 1 RAM) 

General Purpose : t2, t3, a1, m4, m5, m5d
Compute optimised : c4, c5, c5d
GPU : P, G
Memory optimised: r4, r5, r5d, x1e, z1
Storage optimised: d2, i2, i3


Step 3: Additional configurations

Shutdown behavior : STOP
Enable termination protection : YES


Step 4: Add Storage
Root : 30 gb

Step 5 : Add tags

We can define max of 50 tags/ instance.

Step 6: COnfiguyre the Security group.

Security group: Firewall at our instance level. 

Windows : RDP : Remote Desktop Protocol : 3389	: Remote desktop connection
Linux : SSH : Secure shell : 22			: putty / mutty/ moxterm
web : http : 80					: browser
web : https : 443				: browser
Db : Mysql : 3306				: mysql workbench
DB : mssql : 1433				: ssms SQL server management studio

Source : 0.0.0.0/0  (Anywhere)

Open Run --> mstsc --> enter

Step 7: Create a new Keypair and get connected to your ec2 instance.



Task : Launch a Windows ec2 instance with a keypair. Get connected to instance with the password. 

Change the password at OS level, and signout.. Login back to your ec2 instance using Keypair generated password.. try to login with newly setup password.


Task 2: Create a user in Windows server and provide him "Local Admin Rights" and "Remote connection permissions" .

Connect to your ec2 instance as newly created user.

Security Groups : 

Security groups are stateful. We always need to takes care about inbound rules.
By default, all traffic is allowed in outbound rules.


Inbound : Traffic delivering from ec2 instance.
Outbound : Traffic into your ec2 instance. 


EIP : Elastic IP Address : NO FREE TIER ELIGINILITY : Dedicated IP allocated to pour aws environment. We can associate this IP to any resource running in same region.

ENI : Elastic Network Interface : We can create an associate multiple NICs to an ec2 instance. But Instance and NIC should be in Same AZ (Availability Zone).


System Status Checks : These checks monitor the AWS systems required to use this instance and ensure they are functioning properly.

Instance Status check : These checks monitor your software and network configuration for this instance.



Task : Open required ports to ping your ec2 instance. 
Task 2: Install IIS and deliver your website using public ip your ec2 instance. 

Task 3 : Associate multiple ENI to an ec2 instance..  Launch a new ec2 instance, and try to access task 2 outputs using Both the private IP addresses.

Task 4 : Limit the Task 3 output to only newly launched ec2 instance public Ip address using security groups.

Root Device Types : Storage options for our ec2 instances. 
--> Instance Store Volumes
--> EBS VOlumes (Elastic Block Storage)

Instance Store Volumes : Also called as Ephemeral Storages. 
--> THese will not support STOP/START options. 
--> If underlying failure happens, We will loss all the data.
--> We can reboot, if required. We don't loss any data for reboot. 
--> We have only specific instance types to run Instance store volumes. 
--> 3rd party tools to move Instance store data to EBS volumes Ex: NetApp... 

EBS Volumes : 
--> 99.999 % Availability
--> 0.01 - 0.02 Annual Failure value.

SSD : gp2, io1
HDD : st1, sc1
Magnetic : Magnetic / standard

root volume (runs OS c:/ or /) : gp2, io1 and magnetic
Additional volumes : st1, sc1 along with root volumes.. 

We measure storage performance using IOPS (Input and Output operations Per Second)

General Purpose SSD (gp2) : Min 1 GB, Max 16 TB.. Max IOPS : 16,000 only.. 
			1 GB = 3 IOPS , with min of 100... 3000 Burstanble IOPS count..
			Root volumes, Stable/regular workloads, small databases.. 


Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) : Min 4 GB, Max 16 TB.. Max IOPS : 64000 only(Only Nitro).. 
	Default IOPS ratio : 1 GB = 50 IOPS.. We can specify required IOPS count.. 
	NOSQL databases, Production databases, If we need spcific iops count.. 


Magnetic (standard) : Min 1 GB, Max 1 TB.. IOPS N/A.. Less Freq accessed data, Chepest storage.. 

Throughput Optimised HDD (st1):  Min 500 GB, Max 16 TB.. IOPS N/A (500 IOPS), Big data, data warehouses, log processing

COld HDD (SC1) : Min 500 GB, Max 16 TB.. IOPS N/A (250 IOPS).. Colder data requiring fewer scans per day...  

http://aws.amazon.com/ebs


diskmgmt.msc

1 GB Volume --> Create a SS --> Create a volume for another AZ --> Volume in Another AZ 
1 GB Volume --> Create a SS --> Copy SS to ANother region --> Create a volume in AZ
1 GB Volume --> Create a SS --> Share it with Another AWS Account user --> Create avolume
1 GB Volume --> Create a SS --> Make it public --> Whoever knows SS ID, they can create 

Snapshots : 
--> Backup copies of EBS volumes.
--> SNapshots stores in S3 platform. (Not your S3 buckets)
--> Snapshots runs with incremental backup mechanism.
--> We can automate Snapshot creation using DLM (Data Lifecycle Manager) option. 


DLM : Data Lifecycle Manager : We can schedule Instance / volume snapshots automatically.
Need to define the appropriate TAGS.



Task : Configure DLM to create a snapshot for every 2 Hours for a 1gb volume. 

Task 2 : Launch multiple instance in multiple AZs.. And perform attach volumes.

Windows EC2 Instance --> IIS / Change the password --> GoldenAMI 


Linux EC2 Instance : 
____________________

Step 1 : Choose an AMI (Amazon2 Linux AMI)

Step 2 : Choose an Instance (t2.micro)

Step 3 : Additional configurations

Step 4 : Choose storage (GP2/Magnetic : 8/10 GB)

Step 5 : Add Tags (Max 50 Tags/Instance)

Step 6 : COnfigure the Security Groups 
	SSH --> Secure Shell --> Port 22 --> SOurce : 0.0.0.0/0 / MyIP / Custom

Step 7 : create a Keypair. 

	--> Putty : Supports ppk file format (Putty Private Key) : .ppk
	--> Wondows COmmand : Install OpenSSH --> .PEM File
	--> GIT : Use Git Terminal --> .PEM file
	--> MobaXterm / Mutty : .ppk


	PUttyGen --> Tool to convert .PEM file to .ppk file.. / We can even create a new 		     /own ppk files

 putty.org


WIndows with openssh enable / Linux OS / Mac OS: 

ssh -i Keypair.pem username@publicip

chmod 400 XXX.Pem

Cloudwatch: Service to monitor AWS resources..  

EC2 Instance: 
	--> Basic Monitoring : 5 Minutes Interval (Free)
	--> Detailed Monitoring / Enhanced Monitoring : 1 Min (Cost us)

Default Metrics : We can monitor  CPU, Network, Disk and Status checks... We cannot monitor Memory utilisation using Default MEtrics.. 

If you want to monitor Memory utilisation of an ec2 instance, we need to enable custom Metrics and configure the CloudWatch Unified Agent in our ec2 instance.. 

Using cloudwatch unified agent we can send our custom Application logs to AWS..
